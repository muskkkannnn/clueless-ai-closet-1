# Product Requirements Document: Clueless AI Closet MVP

## 🎯 Product Overview

**App Name:** Clueless AI Closet  
**Tagline:** See your outfits come to life before you wear them  
**Launch Goal:** Ship a working MVP in 3 days that lets users visualize AI-generated outfit combinations  
**Target Launch:** 3-day sprint (functional MVP)

## 👥 Who It's For

### Primary User: The Style-Challenged Wardrobe Owner

People who own plenty of clothes but struggle to create good-looking outfit combinations. They often:
- Stare at their closet for 20+ minutes feeling "I have nothing to wear"
- Default to the same 3-5 "safe" outfits on repeat
- Buy new clothes hoping they'll magically know how to style them
- Feel frustrated that they can't see what combinations look good together
- Wish they could preview outfits without the hassle of physically trying on multiple combinations

**Their Current Pain:**
- Mental overload trying to visualize combinations
- Time wasted physically trying on multiple outfits
- Lack of creative outfit ideas
- No visual reference for "does this actually look good together?"

**What They Need:**
- A quick way to see outfit combinations visually
- Confidence that their outfit choices will look good
- Creative inspiration from their existing wardrobe
- A "preview before wearing" solution

### Example User Story
"Meet Sarah, a 28-year-old marketing professional who has a closet full of clothes but wears the same black pants + white shirt combo every week. She buys trendy pieces but never knows how to style them together. She needs a way to visualize different combinations from her wardrobe so she can feel confident trying new outfits without the stress of multiple try-ons each morning."

## 🔧 The Problem We're Solving

**Core Problem:** People struggle to mentally visualize how clothing items will look when combined into an outfit, leading to outfit fatigue, wardrobe underutilization, and decision paralysis.

**Why It Matters:**
- Average person uses only 20% of their wardrobe regularly
- Decision fatigue wastes 10-30 minutes daily for many people
- Lack of styling confidence leads to repetitive outfit choices
- Existing solutions don't show visual previews on a person

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- **Acloset/Whering/Stylebook**: Show flat clothing layouts but don't visualize outfits on a person
- **Pinterest/Instagram**: Inspiration from others' clothes, not your own wardrobe
- **Physical mirror trying**: Time-consuming and limited by energy/motivation
- **Mental visualization**: Difficult for most people; often inaccurate

**Why Now:**
- AI image generation has reached consumer-ready quality
- Free AI tools make this technically feasible
- No competitor offers outfit visualization on models
- Post-pandemic: people want to refresh their style without buying new clothes

### 🚫 NOT in MVP (Saving for Later)

| Feature | Why Wait | Planned For |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| AI Outfit Recommendations | Complex logic; requires training data | Version 2 (Month 2-3) |
| Calendar Planning | Scope creep; not core to validation | Version 2 |
| Social Feed / Sharing | Premature; need users first | Version 2-3 |
| Mobile App | Web-first validates faster | Version 3+ |
| Custom UI Polish | Function over form for MVP | Ongoing post-launch |
| Advanced Try-on (ControlNet) | Requires GPU infrastructure | Version 3-4 |
| User Analytics Dashboard | Not needed for MVP testing | Version 2 |
| Multiple Closets | Edge case; most users have one | Future |
| WhatsApp Direct Share | Download + share works for now | Future |

*Why we're waiting: These features would add 2-4 weeks to development. MVP focuses on core value: "Can we generate outfit visualizations that users find valuable?"*

## ⚡ Technical Considerations

**Platform:** Web-first (responsive)  
**Framework:** Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)  
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS (core utility classes only)  
**UI Components:** Headless components (may add Radix UI post-MVP for polish)

**Performance Goals:**
- **Page Load:** < 3 seconds (initial)
- **Upload Processing:** < 5 seconds (background removal)
- **AI Visualization:** < 20 seconds (manage expectations with loading UI)
- **Image Optimization:** Next.js Image component for thumbnails

**Browser/Device Support:**
- **Desktop:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile:** iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Android (responsive layout)
- **Tablet:** Optimized for tablet landscape/portrait

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- Keyboard navigation for core flows
- Alt text for images
- Color contrast ratios met

## 🛡️ Quality Standards (Anti-Vibe Rules)

### What This App Will NOT Accept:

**Code Quality:**
- ❌ No `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` in artifacts (use React state or Supabase)
- ❌ No API keys exposed in client-side code
- ❌ No "TODO" comments in production code
- ✅ TypeScript where possible (Next.js default)
- ✅ Handle errors explicitly (try-catch with user-friendly messages)
- ✅ Protect API routes with authentication checks

**Design Quality:**
- ❌ No placeholder content in production ("Lorem ipsum", sample images)
- ❌ No broken responsive layouts (test mobile before launch)
- ❌ No inaccessible color contrasts (run basic checks)
- ✅ Use Tailwind utility classes consistently
- ✅ Loading states for all async operations
- ✅ Clear error messages for users

**Feature Quality:**
- ❌ No half-working features—complete or cut
- ❌ No features outside MVP scope (save for v2)
- ❌ No shipping without end-to-end testing
- ✅ One complete user journey works perfectly
- ✅ Critical paths tested with real data
- ✅ Graceful degradation when AI fails

*These standards will be enforced during development with AI coding assistants.*

## 💰 Budget & Constraints

### Development Budget: $0 (Free Tier Only)

**Tool Costs (Monthly):**
- **Clerk Auth:** Free (up to 10K MAU)
- **Supabase:** Free (500MB DB, 1GB storage, 50K MAU)
- **Vercel Hosting:** Free (Hobby plan)
- **Gemini Nano Banana 2.5 API:** Free (rate-limited)
- **Hugging Face Inference API:** Free (rate-limited)
- **Domain (optional):** $12/year (post-MVP)

**Total MVP Cost:** $0/month  
**Expected Cost at 100 Users:** $0-20/month  
**Scale Threshold:** 500-1000 users before needing paid tiers

### Timeline

**3-Day Sprint Breakdown:**
- **Day 1 (8-10 hrs):** Setup + Auth + Database + Upload system
- **Day 2 (10-12 hrs):** Closet UI + Canvas Builder + Basic styling
- **Day 3 (10-12 hrs):** AI visualization pipeline + Save/Download + Testing + Deploy

**Total Development Time:** 28-34 hours (intensive sprint)

### Technical Constraints

**Hard Requirements:**
- Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router) only—no alternatives
- Tailwind CSS for styling—no custom CSS frameworks
- Free-tier tools only—no paid services
- Supabase for database + storage
- Clerk for authentication
- Hugging Face for AI models

**Current Limitations:**
- Rate limits on AI APIs (manage with loading states)
- 5MB file upload limit (reasonable for phone photos)
- No custom model training (use pre-trained only)
- Basic UI polish (Radix UI reserved for post-MVP)

**Not Allowed:**
- No mobile app development (web only)
- No custom backend (Next.js API routes only)
- No paid AI APIs (OpenAI, Replicate, etc.)
- No complex state management libraries (React built-ins sufficient)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| AI visualization quality disappointing | High | High | Set clear expectations with disclaimer; offer "regenerate" option; label as "experimental" |
| Free API rate limits hit during testing | Medium | Medium | Implement queuing system; show "high traffic" message; throttle requests |
| Background removal fails on complex images | Medium | Low | Manual fallback option; guide users to photograph clothes on plain backgrounds |
| 3-day timeline too ambitious | Medium | High | Cut features ruthlessly; focus on one working flow; polish later |
| Users expect perfect virtual try-on | High | Medium | Homepage copy emphasizes "visualization" not "try-on"; show example outputs |
| Technical bugs block launch | Low | High | Daily testing; rollback plan; keep MVP scope minimal |

## Appendix B: AI Pipeline Technical Details

### Image → Text → Image Flow

```
User selects 3 items (top, bottom, shoes)
         ↓
Fetch images from Supabase Storage
         ↓
Call Gemini NanoBanana 2.5 with:
  - reference images
  - a short instruction prompt

<!-- Call BLIP API 3x (caption each item)
  Response: "blue denim jeans", "white cotton t-shirt", "black sneakers" -->
         ↓
<!-- Build prompt: "A fashion model wearing a white cotton t-shirt, 
blue denim jeans, and black sneakers. Full body photo, 
professional fashion photography, studio lighting."
         ↓
Call Stable Diffusion API with prompt
  Processing: 5-10 seconds -->

NanoBanana generates a model wearing the outfit
         ↓
Return generated 512x512 image
         ↓
Save to Supabase Storage + Database
         ↓
Display to user with save/download options
```
